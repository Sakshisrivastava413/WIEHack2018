# InstaPersonalityScan

Our platform helps to do personality check-up by providing a random topic to the user to speak upon, leaving behind the fact whats the user's background is, he/she needs to speak confidently and with zeal. We've submitted a 100% working POC of the platform, since making a full production platform was not possible in such short duration of time. After every sentence spoken by the user, our model will do sentimental and emotional analysis. Also, it captures the facial expression and then convert it into greyscale with focus only in the face and doing the facial analysis of the user which will act as a confidence checker. Lastly the speech and facial analysis will be shown in the form of realtime graphs. And after the user ends speaking, it provides the overall report of the user. In this way, parents and teachers will be able to know how a child is growing in terms of personality and can focus on that accordingly.
